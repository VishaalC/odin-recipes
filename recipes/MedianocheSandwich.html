        <img src="../images/sandwich.jpeg" width="600" height="500" alt="A photo of a sandwich" class="image">
        <h4>One of the most famous sandwiches straight out of the island of Cuba</h4>
        <p>This sandwich is best served with fried plantain chips and a cold mamey milkshake!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 sweet bread rolls</li>
            <li>Â½ cup mayonnaise</li>
            <li>1 pound thinly sliced cooked ham </li>
            <li>1 pound thinly sliced fully cooked pork</li>
            <li>1 pound sliced Swiss cheese</li>
            <li>1 cup dill pickle slices</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Split the sandwich rolls in half, and spread mustard and mayonnaise liberally onto the cut sides.<br>
                On each sandwich, place and equal amount of Swiss cheese, ham and pork in exactly that order.<br>
                Place a few pickles onto each one, and put the top of the roll onto the sandwich.
                Brush the tops with melted butter.<br>
            </li>
            <li>
                Press each sandwich in a sandwich press heated to medium-high heat. <br>
                If a sandwich press is not available, use a large skillet over medium-high heat, and press the sandwiches down using a sturdy plate or skillet. <br>
                Some indoor grills may be good for this also. Cook for 5 to 8 minutes, keeping sandwiches pressed. <br>
                If using a skillet, you may want to flip them once for even browning. <br>
                Slice diagonally and serve hot.
            </li>
        </ol>
